            <h2>Courses I have taken</h2>
            <h4>High Performance Programming with Multicore and GPUs</h4>
            <p>Considers theory and practice of hardware-aware programming. Key theme is obtaining a significant fraction of potential performance through knowledge of the underlying computing platform and how the platform interacts with programs. Studies architecture of, and programming methods for, contemporary high-performance processors. These include complex processor cores, multicore processors, and graphics processors. Laboratory component includes use and evaluation of programming methods on these processors through applications such as matrix operations and the Fast Fourier Transform.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>
            <p>Fundamentals of security related to computers and computer networks. Laws and ethics. Social engineering and psychology-based attacks. Information gathering, network mapping, service enumeration, and vulnerability scanning. Operating system security related to access control, exploits, and disk forensics. Shellcoding. Wired and wireless network security at the physical, network, and application layers. Theoretical lessons are augmented with case studies and demonstrative experimental labs.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
            <p>Linear regression. Maximum likelihood and maximum a posteriori estimation. Classification techniques, including na?ve Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, and support vector machines. Data visualization and feature extraction, including principal components analysis and linear projections. Clustering. Introduction to neural networks and deep learning. Discussion of other modern analysis methods.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Smart & Connected System</h4>
            <p>Hands-on introductory course to cyber-physical and IoT systems. Microcontrollers: integrated development environments (ISEs), architecture, and I/O interfaces. Hardware interfacing of systems: formal design and specifications, real-time OS, programming, and control. IoT systems: smart phones, wireless personal area networks (WPANs), IP gateways, mobile cloud computing, reliability, security, and privacy.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Introduction to Engineering Design</h4>
            <p>We will work in multi-disciplinary teams with time and budget constraints on externally sponsored design projects. Web-based lectures will cover topics concurrent with specific phases of the projects. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Probability, Statistics, and Data Science for Engineers</h4>
            <p>Provides a strong foundation in probability and an introduction to statistics and machine learning. Includes experience with translating engineering problems into probabilistic models, and working with these models analytically and algorithmically. Prepares students for upper-level electives that use probabilistic reasoning. </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Ideas to Impact</h4>
            <p>The course analyzes the conditions that foster innovation as well as the process by which ideas progress from conception to implementation and execution, and the creation of either economic or social impact. Students will be exposed to theories on the conditions that affect the generation and development of creativity and innovation within individuals, teams, cities, and regions. To foster experiential learning, the whole class will be structured around the process of innovation with a "live case" that focuses on creating social innovations for the City of Boston. When people think about great social challenges, they often look afar to distant countries. Yet, many social problems lie right around the corner from students' daily lives. Students will develop a toolkit comprised of brainstorming, design thinking, human centered design, prototyping, storyboarding and field research.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Introduction to Clean energy Generation and Storage Technologies
</h4>
            <p>This course covers a wide variety of modern energy generation and storage technologies. The engineering principles that govern thermomechanical, thermoelectric,photvotaic and elctrochemical energy conversion processes will be discussed along with the challenges of hydrogen storage and hybrid batteries. The consequences of using renewable energy resources such as solar, hydrogen, biomass, geothermal, hydro, and wind versus non-renewable fossil fuels and nuclear resources will also be covered.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Applied Algorithms for Engineers</h4>
            <p>Introduction to the general concept of algorithms. Efficiency and run-time of algorithms. Graph algorithms, priority queues, search trees. Various approaches to design of algorithms and data structures, together with their applications to numerical and non-numerical problems.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Computer Organization</h4>
            <p>Introduction to the fundamentals and design of computer systems. Topics covered include computer instruction sets, assembly language programming, arithmetic circuits, CPU design (data path and control, pipelining), performance evaluation, memory devices, memory systems including caching and virtual memory, and I/O.</p>
